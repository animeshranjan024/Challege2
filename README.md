Branching Exercise 
---

1. Make a new folder called `Patronus`


2. Make a new git repo inside the folder (make sure you're not in an existing repo)


3. Create a new file called `patronous.txt` (leave it empty for now)


4. Add and commit the empty file, with the message ["add empty patronus file"]()


5. Immediately make a new branch called `harry` and another branch called `snape`(both based on the master branch)


6. Move to the `harry` branch using the "new command to change branches".


7. In the `patronus.txt` file, add the following:
``` 
	HAAPY'S PATRONUS

	This is Harry Branch
```


8. Add and commit the changes, with the commit message ["add harry's stage patronus"]()


9. Move over to the `snape` branch sing the "older" command to change branches.


10. Put the following text in the `patronus.txt` file:
```
	SNAPE'S PATRONUS

	This is the Snape Branch
```


11. Add and commit the changes on the `snape` branch with the commit message ["add snape's doe patronus"]()


12. Next, create a new branch based upon the `snape` branch called `lily`


13. Move to the `lily` branch


14. Edit the `patronus.txt` file so that it says `LILY'S PATRONUS` at the top instead of `SNAPE'S PATRONUS` (leave the doe ascii-art alone)


15. Add and commit the change with the message ["add lily's doe patronus"]()


16. Run a git command to list all branches (you should see 4)


17. **Bonus:** delete the `snape` branch (poor Snape).
